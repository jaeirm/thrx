# Thrx

> Transform linear chat into an **interactive, node-based flow** that visualizes ideas, context, and dialogue as a **living knowledge graph**.  
> Built for clarity, collaboration, and creativity — to explore, branch, and flow through conversations like a **mind map in motion**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Thrx** reimagines how conversations are represented.  
Instead of scrolling through endless chat logs, Thrx lets you **see conversations as connected nodes** — each message, branch, and idea becomes part of a dynamic, visual flow.

Whether you’re building an AI chat app, a collaborative note system, or a knowledge engine — Thrx provides the foundation.
